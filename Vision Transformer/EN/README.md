## Introduction

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model, introduced in the paper "An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" by Dosovitskiy et al., challenges the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by utilizing transformer-based self-attention mechanisms for image classification. It demonstrates the effectiveness of transformers in handling image data directly, opening new avenues for research and applications in computer vision.

This repository aims to provide a step-by-step implementation of the Vision Transformer in PyTorch, allowing both newcomers and experienced practitioners to explore the inner workings of this groundbreaking model.
