## Introduction

The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, introduced in the paper "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-training" by Radford et al., has revolutionized natural language generation by leveraging transformer-based architectures. It demonstrates the power of transformers in capturing language patterns and generating coherent and contextually relevant text, contributing to advancements in chatbots, text completion, and more.

This repository aims to guide you through a step-by-step implementation of the GPT model in PyTorch. Whether you're new to transformer-based models or an experienced practitioner, you'll find valuable insights and educational content here.
