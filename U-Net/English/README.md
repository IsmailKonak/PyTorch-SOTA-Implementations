## Introduction

The U-Net architecture, introduced in the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Ronneberger et al., is a widely used convolutional neural network architecture for tasks like image segmentation. Its unique design, with a contracting and an expansive path, allows for accurate pixel-level predictions while leveraging contextual information.

This repository aims to provide a step-by-step implementation of the U-Net architecture in PyTorch, offering a hands-on opportunity for both newcomers and experienced practitioners to understand the architecture's intricacies.
