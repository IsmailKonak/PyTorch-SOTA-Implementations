## Introduction

The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., is a groundbreaking architecture that employs self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual information across sequences. It has become a fundamental building block for various state-of-the-art models in natural language processing, including BERT, GPT, and more.

This repository aims to demystify the Transformer model by providing a step-by-step implementation in PyTorch. Whether you're new to transformers or seeking a deep dive into the details, you'll find valuable insights and educational content here.

## Project Status
